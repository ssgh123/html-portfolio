<h1>Sarah's Favorite Movies</h1>

<h2>I don't know if these are actually my favorite, but I'm being forced to choose</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Parent Trap</h3>
<p>I love this movie, it is very nostalgic to me.</p>

<h3>She's The Man</h3>
<p>This movie's goofy, but never fails to make me laugh.</p>

<h3>Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion</h3>
<p>Another goofy movie, but also very nostalgic. You can tell I like lighthearted, non-serious movies. </p>
